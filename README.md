# DVDSS-SDL3
This is an example of a retro DVD screensaver I did to experiment with SDL 3
Ideally, this is the pipeline into generating additional graphics.


# Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by: [How to make a 3d Renderer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvWDgBGcAIM&t)
It uses SDL3 with some debugging from AI (OpenAI Chatgpt 4.0)

*I did NOT change anything about SDL3! Please get it from here: [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)


# Compiling :
This project has a make file, if everything is setup for make, type make in the console. Otherwise, you may need to type make-mingw32(?) since this is built on 32bit.
You will also need the dll files
